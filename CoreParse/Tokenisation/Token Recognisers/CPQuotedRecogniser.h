/**
 * The CPQuotedRecogniser class is used to recognise quoted literals in the input string.  This can be used for quoted strings, characters, comments and many other things.
 * 
 * Quoted tokens are recognised via a start string and end string.  You may optionally add an escape sequence string that stops the end quote being recognised at that point in the input.
 * You may optionally provide a block used to replace escape sequences with their actual meaning.  If you don't provide an escape replcement block it is assumed that the character
 * following the escape sequence replaces the whole sequence.
 *
 * Finally, you may also provide a maximum length for the quoted sequence to recognise.  If you want to recognise strings of any length, pass NSNotFound.
 * 
 * This recogniser produces CPQuotedTokens.  The name of the produced tokens is determined by the name property.
